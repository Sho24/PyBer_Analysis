# PyBer_Analysis

# City Ride data analysis with Jupyter Notebook, matplotliblibrary with Python code

## Overview of Project
    The overview of project is to analysis PyBer data, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. Create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type and help them to determine how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer. 

#### Results:
    # Total rides for each city type:
        -	After analysis and grouping data count on city type and summing total ride per cities the results show that Urban has more number of rides compare to other           2 cities [Suburban & Rural]

        Suburban :  625
        Urban       :  1625

    # Total drivers for each city type
        As per the data analysis results, total number of driver per city Urban has more number of driver compare to other 2 cities [Suburban & Rural]
